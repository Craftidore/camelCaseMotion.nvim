# camelCaseMotion.nvim

- Inspired by [bkad's CamelCaseMotion](https://github.com/bkad/CamelCaseMotion), but written in lua.
- An intentionally simple plugin to help me figure out how neovim plugins work.
- Thank you to [pseudometa](https://github.com/chrisgrieser) for giving me the idea to make this.

## Install & Setup

Currently the plugin is non-functional, so you can't use it.

## License

Since I'll probably be taking code from bkad's CamelCaseMotion plugin, which in turn took code from a vimtip by Anthony Van Ham, I shall have to investigate further on their licenses before I can determine what the license for this plugin will be.
